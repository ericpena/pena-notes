## Logistic Growth Model

The simple difference equation below will show exponential growth behavior:

$$x_t = a x_{t-1}$$

However, it is often the case that a population cannot grow indefinitely but rather reach a population limit. This limit is called the population's carrying capacity. To create a model with exponential growth but also incorporate this convergence to a population maximum limit, we may start with the following train of thought:

$$x_t = f(x_{t-1}) x_{t-1}$$

The constraints that $f(x_{t-1})$ has to satisfy is that it must pass through the points $(x, f(x)) = (0,a) $ and $(K, 1)$, where $K$ is a constant that represents the carrying capacity of the population. The simplest model would be a straight line using these two points:

$$f(x) = -\frac{a-1}{K}x+a$$

We may now use this growth ratio function to put back into our difference equation:

$$x_t = \left(-\frac{a-1}{K}x_{t-1}+a\right) x_{t-1}$$

This is generally called the \emph{logistic growth model} written in terms of a difference equation and may be further simplified:
$$x_t = \left( - \frac{a-1}{K} x_{t-1} + a \right) x_{t-1} = x_{t-1} + r x_{t-1}\left( 1 - \frac{x_{t-1}}{K} \right)$$

where $r = a -1 $.

The logistic growth model for varying growth ratios in shown below.

This may also be written in terms of a differential equation for the continuous version of this model:

$$\frac{d x(t)}{d t} = r x(t) \left( 1 - \frac{x(t)}{K}\right)$$

## Preamble


```python
from pylab import *
```

## Defining Logistic Map


```python
def f(x, r):
    return r*x*(1-x)
```

## Period Doubling Bifurcation $(r = 3.1)$


```python
x = 0.01
r = 3.1
xdata = [x]
for t in range(100):
    x = f(x, r)
    xdata.append(x)
plot(xdata, 'r.');
```

## Creating Bifurcation Diagram


```python
rvalues = []
xvalues = []
for r in linspace(2.5, 3.7, 500):
    x = 0.01
    for t in range(200):
        x = f(x, r)
        if t > 100:
            rvalues.append(r)
            xvalues.append(x)
        
plot(rvalues, xvalues, 'r.', alpha = 0.05);
```
