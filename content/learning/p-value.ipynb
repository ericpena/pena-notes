    "To explain what a p-value is, I will start with the \"**p**\". What does it stand for? If you're thinking *probability*, then you're correct. The tricky question becomes: *the probability of what?* One definition might be: a p-value is the probability of getting an observed value of the test statistic (or more extreme value), given that the null hypothesis is true. Sounds confusing, I know. Variants of this definition are also used but generally this language doesn't help if you're actually trying to learn it. Let's break this topic down with the use of a story."
