    "### Choosing 3 Socks from 3 Pairs\n",
    "* For clarity, let's assume there are 3 pairs of socks and we're choosing 3 individual socks one by one.\n",
    "* We have to think about this as literal as possible so when there are no socks in your hand, we have to choose one. What is the probability of choosing a single sock? Well, it's $100\\\\%$. Of course it is!\n",
    "* The real magic happens when the second sock is chosen. What is the probability of choosing a sock given that it's not similar to one you previously chose?\n",
    "* Well you have $(2 \\cdot n - 1)$ socks left to choose from but only $(2 \\cdot n - 2)$ of them are *valid* (i.e., non-matching). So this conditional probability for the second sock becomes:\n",
    "$$\\frac{2\\cdot n - 2}{2\\cdot n - 1}$$\n",
    "* We want to generalize this a bit so let's say that the first sock we chose was sock zero $(i = 0)$ and the second sock we chose was sock one $(i = 1)$. We will continue this pattern with the $i^{th}$ sock.\n",
    "* With this notation we can rewrite the probability for the first and second sock $(i = 0\\text{ and }i = 1)$ as:\n",
    "$$P_{i\\text{ = }0} = 1$$\n",
    "$$P_{i\\text{ = }1} = \\frac{2\\cdot n - 2\\cdot i}{2\\cdot n - i} = \\frac{2\\cdot 3 - 2\\cdot 1}{2\\cdot 3 - 1} = \\frac{4}{5}$$\n",
    "* So for the third sock $(i = 2)$, we ask what is the probability of choosing a sock given that it doesn't match what you already have:\n",
    "$$P_{i\\text{ = }2} = \\frac{2\\cdot n - 2\\cdot i}{2\\cdot n - i} = \\frac{2\\cdot 3 - 2\\cdot 2}{2\\cdot 3 - 2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n",
    "* Finally, to end this \"three socks/three pairs\" example, we'll just multiply all these individual probabilities together to get a final probability! The probability of choosing three socks from three pairs such that none of them match is:\n",
    "$$P_{i\\text{ = }0} \\cdot P_{i\\text{ = }1} \\cdot P_{i\\text{ = }2} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 0.40 = 40\\\\%$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generalizing One-by-One Sock Pulling\n",
    "* Let's generalize this solution by saying that we have $n$ pairs of socks in a basket and we're choosing $k$ individual socks one by one. The probability that all $k$ of the chosen socks are unique is:\n",
    "$$P = \\prod^{k - 1 \\le n - 1}_{i\\text{ = }0}\\frac{2\\cdot n - 2\\cdot i}{2\\cdot n - i}$$\n",
    "* The $(k - 1 \\le n - 1)$ is just to guarantee that we're able to actually have unmatched socks. If we choose too many socks (i.e., more than the number of pairs), we will HAVE to choose a matching pair (and we don't like matching socks).\n",
    "* Let push our luck a bit. Say that the number of socks we choose ($k$) is always equal to the number of pairs ($n$) that are in the basket. I say that this is pushing our luck because the probability of having $k = n$ unique socks is the lowest (this is the largest $k$ that we are allowed to choose). If this doesn't make sense, take a minute to think about this. Just like in life, it's less likely for things to go our way when we ask for too much.\n",
    "* Now we can easily compute probabilities for several $n=k$ values!\n",
    "* For example, when there are 7 pairs of socks, the probabilities of chosen 7 single socks and them all being unique (i.e., non-matching) is about $3.73\\\\%$."
